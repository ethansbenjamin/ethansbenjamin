#### I'm Ethan, a Computer Science student at Carleton University. I care about leveraging technology to optimize the human experience. In my spare time, I enjoy writing, conversations, and coffee.

Here are some of my core values and beliefs:

*Pay it forward:* People in my life have guided me through many challenges and uncertainties. Paying it forward is the best way to help others and appreciate what people have done for me.

*Comparison is the thief of joy:* The internet has made it so much more convenient to compare ourselves to one another. Recognizing this fact is liberating.

*People make the world special:* The best moments I have are correlated to the friends that I experience it with. I live to connect with people in meaningful ways.

*The most fulfilling experiences are difficult:* Hardships and challenges are what make achieving something fulfilling.
